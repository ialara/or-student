        "\n",
        "Python is an object-oriented (OO) language, but what does that mean? Most modern programs have an OO architecture, in which the \"world\" is modeled in terms of self-contained objects. Objects have certain characteristics or \"nouns,\" called _data attributes_, and certain capabilities or \"verbs,\" called _methods_. Coding in an OO language involves creating (or _instantiating_) the objects you need, then doing what you want by calling methods of objects and querying and assigning instance variables to or from other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a programming paradigm known as _procedural_ programming simply presents a set of instructions or routines which are executed by the computer in order. One example of procedural programming is found in Stata do files.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ok, so what's a class?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the simplest sense, classes are \"object blueprints,\" they define the _template_ or instructions for how to produce a certain kind of object. If you wanted to represent your specific pet in Python, the `Dog` or `Cat` class might have properties like `name`, `age`, or `weight`. It might also have methods like `bark()`, `fetch()`, or `sleep()`. So if your pet Fido was a 5 year old dog weighing 40 pounds, you could create a `fido` _object_ by calling the `Dog` _class_, and giving it the relevant values for its data attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The `__init__()` method: an object's DNA\n",
        "Every class needs an `__init__()` method, which is automatically called when you try to instantiate a new object of the class. Without the `__init__()`, you'll only get an empty object - nobody's home. Note that this is a built-in function name, and it is surrounded by a double underscore `__` on each side. Think of it as DNA, it contains the instructions that will automatically run each time an object is instantiated, and can be used to set some data attributes right away. For our `Dog` class, the `__init__()` method might accept three arguments in addition to the special word `self`, which we'll explain later. So the `Dog` class' `__init__()` function might look something like\n",
        "```\n",
        "def __init__(self, name, age, weight):\n",
        "    self.name = name\n",
        "    self.age = age\n",
        "    self.weight = weight\n",
        "```\n",
        "Now, any time you try to create a `Dog`, you will assign the data attributes of `name`, `age` and `weight` automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Got it, but what about `self`?\n",
        "\n",
        "When you're working inside a class definition, `self` is what distinguishes the specific instantiation of the object from the class itself. For example, classes can also have class variables, which belong to all instances of the class. One such class variable for our `Dog` class could be `legs = 4`. If your poor dog encountered tragedy and you needed to amputate a paw, you might include a method in the `Dog` class called `amputate_paw()`. But you wouldn't want to reduce the number of legs shared by _all_ dogs: only your specific instantiation. The `amputate_paw()` function would then include something like `self.legs = legs - 1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technically, you don't have to use the word `self` to do this, Python will treat whatever the first argument is as the reference to the current instance. But this is another one of those conventions that border on unwritten Python law...you will surely confuse the community (and more than likely yourself) if you stray from using `self` to refer to the current instance.\n",

The distinction is subtle, but important. Above, `mylist` pointed to a list object, and when we changed the list object, `mylist` stayed pointing at the object; it was the object itself that changed. On the other hand, when we did `x += 1`, the _reference_ of `x` itself is what changed, 5 is still 5.

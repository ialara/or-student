# Operations Research - Simulation
Welcome to the GitHub repo we will use to provide template HW assignments.

Notation:
- `<custom-things>` represent placeholders for your own values. They should be replaced by the value, do not include the `<>`. For example, `cd <your-mydir-path>` would be entered as `cd C:\Users\john\path\to\mydir`

## Instructions
The homeworks are provided as Colab notebooks. If you're not familiar with Colab, you can learn more about it [here](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/), but it is basically a cloud-based Jupyter notebook hosted by Google that lets us code in Python without worrying about installation, and leverage some Google-sized computational hardware. Best of all, it's free!

Each homework assignment will have the form `Homework_<#>_Questions.ipynb`. Any data you need to complete the assignments will be hosted in the `Data` folder. 

**Note: In Colab, you can read the data by using a link like this: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ialara/or-student/main/Data/<data-file-name>.<ext>`**.

To complete the homeworks:
1. Open the assignment in Colab, by clicking on the badge at the top of the notebook that says "Open in Colab."
3. Answer the prompts in new Text or Code cells as appropriate. **Don't forget to add your name!**
4. When you're done, click File > Download > Download ipynb and email your completed notebook. **Name it `Sim_HW<#>_<Lastname>.ipynb` (e.g. `Sim_HW1_Lara.ipynb`)**
5. ???
6. Profit.

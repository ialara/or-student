Make sure the increments in initial force strengths are 10 (not 1 or prepare for a loooong wait). Even with increments of 10, it took about 15 minutes on my computer to calculate all of the points. Use a circular marker with size 1 in your plot so you can see the monotonicities."

        "Replicate Figure 1-6 from Tom Lucas’ A Study of Non-Monotonicity and Randomness in Combat Models.  The initial blue forces are 500.  The initial red forces vary from 500 to 3,000 in steps of 10. To reduce the time required to produce these plots from “crazy long” to just “very long,” use 100 replications rather than the 1,000 that Tom used. Use the values or distributions for the parameters associated with each figure as give in the table below. Your figures, of course, will have greater variance, but should have an overall trend that replicates his figures, except for figure 5.  I don’t know how he got that figure, but my calculations yield something different.  Caution!  It took me between 30 and 60 minutes to create each of these figures.  So, after you hit the “run” button, do OJT, answer email, talk to your family or friends, check your social media, put on a good movie, etc."

Avoid the temptation to ask anyone (other than me!) “just one little question.”  Do not ask Nacho.  He’s got a dissertation to complete!  Do your own work.  Email me if you have any questions. Begin the subject line with “O&S Final” (or I might miss your email).\n",

        "Whatever forces he does not use in the initial attack are kept in reserve and used according to the threshold, quanity in a block, and delay rules.  \n",
        "\n",
        "As he thinks this through, he realizes that he might want to attack with an initial force that does not leave a number of reinforcements that is evenly divisible by 300 (the quantity in each reinforcement block).  In this case, all but the last reinforcement block will have 300 and the last one will have the remainder.  For example, if he attacks with 2,600 soldiers, he will have 800 in reserve.  This will allow him to have three reinforcement blocks.  The first two will have 300 and the last one will have the remaining 200."
